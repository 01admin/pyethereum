    Tips for writing test code for behave

        1. write test scenario in *xxx.feature*
        2. run `behave`, then behave will report the newly written scenario are
           not implemented, and code skeleton for the corresponding steps will
           also be generated.
        3. copy & copy the generated code skeleton in a file in the *steps*
           directory and then write your own codes basing on it.

#.  Should write codes compatible with Python3
#.  codes should pass PEP8 check.
